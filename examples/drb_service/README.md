# Voicemeeter Remote API Distributed Ruby Service

This example demonstrates how to add networking support to the ruby wrapper.

### Use

Run server.rb on the machine your Voicemeeter is installed on.

Run client.rb on any other machine that can ping the server location.

Change the hostname and port in both files to the server ip and port.
